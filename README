Monredis -- monitor redis status by sentinel channel, and send information to
haproxy:
1.if slave down, haproxy slave server status is down
2.if slave re-online, haproxy slave server status is online
3.if switch-master, haproxy down current master, and up new master.

This HA case:  master can read/write only!
